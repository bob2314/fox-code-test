# MeteorJS Gif Maker


## A Code Test Project for Fox (FNG) 


## 1. Goals

Create a Meteor package (Sample via box.com) that encapsulates the following functionality:

1) Accept 5 images as input via browse or drag and drop Accept a numeric input in milliseconds Given the 5 images, create an animated gif that changes images at the specified millisecond input in step 2 Once the gif is created, display on a web page And then give the user the ability to download the gif to store it on their local computer.

2) Provide methods or application to test the package functionality Comment your code as appropriate (no need to comment every line. Only when necessary to clarify) 

3) Publish to github including md file and provide us with the repository link via email Resources:

    Install via:
 ```curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh```

## 4. Testing <a name="testing"></a>
* TBD


## 5. Code style <a name="code-style"></a>
* Include code style check before build process.
* Use [ESLint - Pluggable JavaScript linter](http://eslint.org/) to enforce code style.
* Use [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for JavaScript.  [Read more Â· GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/duk/airbnb-javascript-guidelines/details).
* Use [Flow type style check rules for ESLint.](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-flowtype) for [FlowType](https://flow.org/).
* Use `.eslintignore` to exclude file or folders from code style check.
* Remove any of your `eslint` disable comments before making a Pull Request.
* Always use  `//TODO:`  comments to remind yourself and others about an unfinished job.
* Always comment and keep them relevant as code changes.
* Remove commented block of code when possible.
* Avoid js alerts in production.
* Avoid irrelevant or funny comments, logs or naming (source code may get handed over to another company/client and they may not share the same banter).
* Write testable code, avoid side effect, extract side effects, write pure functions.
* Make your names search-able with meaningful distinctions avoid shortened names. For functions Use long, descriptive names. A function name should be a verb or a verb phrase, and it needs to communicate its intention.
* Organize your functions in a file according to the step-down rule. Higher level functions should be on top and lower levels below. It makes it more natural to read the source code.
